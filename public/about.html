  I'm a Ruby on Rails + JavaScript developer based in Brooklyn, NY, with
  backgrounds in physics and music. As a recent graduate of the Web Development Immersive at
  The Flatiron School, I'm currently looking for opportunities to join a team
  dedicated to writing clean, maintainable code and delivering awesome experiences
  to its users.
