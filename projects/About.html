  Reuben Son (b. 1986) is a software developer and sound artist based in NYC.

  As a sound artist, he explores the notion of composition as the deployment of strategies for dealing with the propositional materiality of sound.
  Drawing from the origins of computing within the history of textile production, his current body of work attempts to formalize this idea of sonic materiality by abstracting principles of weaving and textile design into a generative framework for electronic music production.

  <!-- Materials generated in this way may then be composed into time-based forms with concerns that align less with the goal of musical expression, but rather, of designing a listening experience. -->
