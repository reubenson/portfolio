p.
  Reuben Son is an NYC-based software developer and sound artist.

p.
  In his work with sound, he utilizes generative systems in which sonic material is procedurally generated from pre-determined rules or conditions. Drawing from the origins of computing within the history of textile production, the slippery notion of the materiality of sound is formalized by applying abstractions of weaving and textile design to electronic music production. The resulting sonic materials may then be composed into forms in a manner that is guided more by the idea of designing a listening experience, as opposed to a means of musical expression.
