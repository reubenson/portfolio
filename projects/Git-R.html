  Git-R is a web application for managing your GitHub projects, essentially providing a dashboard view into your hosted repositories with additional features such as live notifications of changes to your repositories, project statistics, and the ability to create and update issues and milestones directly from Git-R. It was created as a capstone project at The Flatiron School by Reuben Son, Ben Stewart, Jeff Slutzky, and Hedi Essid.

  OAuth is used to handle logins through GitHub, and the GitHub API is used extensively to both pull user and repository data, as well as push data pertaining to milestones and issues back up to GitHub. A dynamically loading dashboard view was implemented using AJAX, jQuery, and custom controller actions, and analytics are displayed using D3 and advanced ActiveRecord queries. RSpec tests were also written for models, controllers, and features.
