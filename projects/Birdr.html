  Birdr is a single-page web application for discovering and identifying birds in your neighborhood. It was built by Reuben Son as a student at The Flatiron School using Ruby/Rails, Javscript, jQuery, AJAX, CSS3, and HTML5.

  Bird observation data is obtained through API calls to the eBird database, which was created in 2002 by the National Audubon Society and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology to log birding submitted provided by birders across the globe. Information and images specific to each bird species is supplied by querying the Wikipedia API.
