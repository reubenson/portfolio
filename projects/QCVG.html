  The QCVG (Quad Control Voltage Generator) is a hardware and software package
  designed and developed for computerized
  control of an analogue modular synthesizer. On the hardware side, the QCVG is
  comprised of an Arduino Nano microcontroller interfaced to a pair of dual-DAC
  chips, which provide four channels of 0-4V CV (control voltage), and four
  trigger outputs (for triggering envelope generators in the synthesizer). Each
  CV output may be patched into an oscillator to control its pitch, and the
  trigger outputs are to be patched into envelope generators to control the
  articulation of notes through a voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA).
  The C++ library for the QCVG is still under development and a small
  production run of the hardware may be produced in the future.
